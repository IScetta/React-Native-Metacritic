        Including Portal and Portal 2, the Companion Collection comes to
        Nintendo Switch with all the groundbreaking gameplay, dark humor, and
        exploration that earned the series hundreds of awards.\r\n\r\nIn Portal,
        you'll use a highly experimental portal device to solve physical puzzles
        and challenges. Maneuver objects--and yourself--through space to puzzle
        your way through the mysterious Aperture Science
        Laboratories.\r\n\r\nReturn to Aperture Laboratories in Portal 2 where
        you'll once again face off with the lethally inventive, power-mad A.I.
        named GLaDOS. Meet an expanded cast of characters as you think your way
        through dangerous, never-before-seen areas of the laboratories and a
        wider variety of portal puzzles. Plus Portal 2 also includes a
        co-operative game mode with local, split-screen and online multiplayer
        so you and a friend can think with portals.
